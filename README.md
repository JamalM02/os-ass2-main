 ˆ Assignment 2

 ˆ Oprating System

 ˆ Semester A Year 2024

 ˆ Total hours on the assignment: about 50 hours

 ˆ This part of the assignment will be a start toward C system programming, including file processing, string
   processing, and the use of fork/wait. The program is solvable without the use of advanced C elements that
   we will learn later on in the course.
   The program will perform a simple task: when given a list of text files, it prints out all of the lines in the
   files that have words of uniform length.
